## Features
You can use the kg and rep inputs to track your max kg and reps for every exercise, which will appear in every workout, except the first one.

Unfortunatelly, the exercises are hardcoded to my personal workout. Feel free to change it to suit your needs and custom workouts.

You can contact me if you have any questions regarding this app.
